# visionbased_human_motion_analysis_in_gymnastics

This repository contains code for the paper 'Vision Based Human Motion Analysis In Gymnastics' written by Sofus Konglevoll, Morten Holck and Gustav Bakhauge. 

The project consists of two parts: collecting and creating a data set and classifying sub-actions within these videos.

The data set consists of ~200 videos of homemade gymnastics videos labelled frame by frame with one of four labels: Idle, Take-off, Skill or Landing. 
To classify the label of each frame we compared two models a CNN and a bi-LSTM - The code for these models are in the folder called 'models'.

This github links to the paper Visionbased Human Motion Analysis made by Sofus Konglevoll, Morten Holck and Gustav Bakhauge. 
In the research we explore human action recognition in the fied of gymnastics. We train a CNN and an LSTM on top of an extracted HPE skeleton to predict subactions in a skill sequence.

All the data and the results are stored in a shared OneDrive folder due to space. If interested in the dataset write us an email on sosk@itu.dk
